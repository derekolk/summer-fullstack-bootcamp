Documentation \u00b6 The documentation is intended to be consumed top down (objectives to plan) in order to provide a high level view and fill in details along the way. Also, these are living documents that are going to be filled out during the summer. Principles \u00b6 When building software, we document principles that we use to provide the collective team mindset that we want to incorporate into our build. Below are some of the principles that we will be using with the project: Team Focused \u00b6 We want to work as a team, make decisions together, document and move forward. Learn over Failure \u00b6 We never fail, we only learn. Keeping this growth mindset principle should come in handy. Explore, Try, and Reach Out \u00b6 There are many ways to solve problems and sometimes we need to explore alternatives (via google searches), and try them out. We want to explore, and try before we ask. We reach out when we have been stuck for 20 minutes. Keep It Simple Silly \u00b6 We prefer simplicity over complexity in both code, and project process.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"These docs are used to provide a central location for information about this summer\u2019s bootcamp.
